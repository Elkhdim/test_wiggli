# How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?


As for technology, I chose React because it is very fast compared to other existing technologies. It also gives me the freedom to write code without restrictions, unlike Angular for example. As for architecture, I split the components into several parts to make it easier for the user to understand the code.

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

As for the improvements, I see that if I had enough time, I would improve the function of the functions and reduce the code to the maximum possible, using the functions of the special tables of JavaScript, and I will also improve the work of CSS.

# What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

If I had enough time, I would add Test Unit to improve the work of the functions and ensure that they work well.
